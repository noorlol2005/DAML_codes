My other friend (let us name him P) reach out to our friend group and said J has been ghosting us. Which is true, J has been rarely responding us even tho we reach out him. He said hes been overthinking a lot, his anxiety has been rising, and he needs time alone. Cut off from social media and everything. I understand and comply with his wish.However, there is something that is been bothering me with what P said. P suggests we should distance him, and show disappointment and negative emotions towards him. P believes that if we comply with him, it will only make him take granted for what we are doing and become selfish. Basically what P wants is that he wants J to know his behavior are cowardly and disrespectful to people around him, and that he should not ghost, rather confront us.I do not know what to do. Should we just leave him alone and let him figure it out. Or we make him learn that he should not ghost, but by harsh approach. Taking initiative and confronting him is also possible, but I do not know the right timing. If you have any other approaches, Ill gratefully listen to it. Thanks in advanceOn a side note, Ps intentions are for Js benefit. But its just not clicking with me. I may be bias by I try my best not to antagonize P. I want to help my friend, but do not know what to do.\",\n          \"NSFWI have been depressed since a child. I watched my grandfather die at age 4 of a heart attack in front of me, I was sexually assaulted by my neighbors and age 7 my bio dad passed away. When I was 12 one of my friends committed suicide by hanging himself in his home. I lost my paternal grandma age 18, my maternal grandma age 20 and step grandma age 21 all whom I was extremely close with. I lost my uncle a few weeks before Christmas due to a heart attack just after losing my paternal grandmother right before Thanksgiving.In 2015 my cousin was murdered (shot in the back of the head) in 2018 my paternal grandfather to a heart attack and we had to pull the plug, he died on my fathers birthday 6 February which is 6 days before my birthday. Also, in June 2018 I lost my younger brother due to a devastating car accident that left his body mangled and we found this out the day after it happened, right after my other grandfathers funeral. My brother did not have his ID on him so they could not identify him immediately.2020 I lost my aunt due to a heart attack two days after Thanksgiving. 14 January 21 I lost my mother after her battled with Covid-19. Due to having small children, one with severe respiratory issues and the pandemic I had not seen my mother. The last time I saw her alive was in early December at my aunts funeral. That was the last time I hugged her and held her hand.Forward to March and I lost another aunt, she lost her battle with leukemia.there is more death and many other reasons but my main trigger has been death/loss. I have cried because I am tired of living and want to end my life. I get angry that I have kids because I am afraid of what my loss will do to them and my wife. Especially, after already losing a brother and recently losing two aunts and our mother, I am afraid of what would happen to my brothers if I kill myself.But, the desire is increasing everyday. I am miserable, in a miserable marriage with a wife that does not get me and cares solely that her needs (physical touch) are not being met.I am just ready to leave life behind! Death cannot come soon enough\",\n          \"I posted this in another community and got a lot of comments of saying that I may have depression. I never thought that I would have depression, but someone said that its possible to have it but not know it. I am putting strain on my marriage, and I do not know how to fix it.Hello Everyone,I am a boring and emotionless person and I cannot really find anything to fix it. Its really putting a strain on my marriage because I can see my wife wanting something more. I just do not know if its from my past or if its a hormonal thing. I am only 22 and I should be a lot more out there. My wife says its from my past and how my father was not really there and my mother was not really worth looking up to. And that because of all that I was never taught how to love a woman. My wife also said I should see a therapist about it. But I do not know how talking with someone will help. So, I am reaching out here first. I believe it has to do something with my testosterone or something because I just never feel like doing anything fun.And one thing that I really do not understand is why my sex drive is so low. Like I stated earlier. I am 22 years old. I should want to always have sex. And I feel like that is also putting some strain on our marriage too.
